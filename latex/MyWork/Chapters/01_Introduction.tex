\textcite{eitz2012hdhso} collected a dataset of 20,000 sketches and divided them
into 250 categories of 80 images each. Humans recognized on average 73.1\% of 
these sketches correctly. This dataset is used in my work to train and validate
the classifier to choose which animation is the most appropriate to show.

\textcite{10.1145/3469877.3490565} proposes a pipeline to create rigged and
animated characters from a single image. Their solution aims for a holistic
approach, requiring no user intervention, to assist non-professional users in
creating animated characters.
