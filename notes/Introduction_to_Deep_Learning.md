# Notes

## Preface

*pluralis modestiae* - Use plural first person pronouns, this includes author and reader in the text. Makes scientific and mathematical writing more inclusive.

## Chapter 1 - From Logic to Cognitive Science

Artifical intelligence and Neural Networks (Deep Learning), have a long history rooted in philosophy.

The chapter discusses differences between learning (Deep NN are good at this) and reasoning.

## Chapter 2 - Mathematical and Computational Prerequisites

**:=** means defining | **A := xy** means "xy is called A"

A bag or multiset does remember repetitions of elements but not order.
A vector cares both about order and repetitions.

Lists are mutable, Tuples are imutable.
